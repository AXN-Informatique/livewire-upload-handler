# Installation

## Install Package

```bash
composer require axn/livewire-upload-handler
```

## Add Blade Directives

In your layout file (e.g., `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php`):

```blade
<head>
    @livewireStyles
    @livewireUploadHandlerStyles
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content -->

    @livewireScripts
    @livewireUploadHandlerScripts
</body>
```

## Publish Assets (Optional)

### Config

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire-upload-handler:config
```

Creates `config/livewire-upload-handler.php`

### Translations

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire-upload-handler:translations
```

Publishes to `lang/vendor/livewire-upload-handler/`

### Views

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire-upload-handler:views
```

Publishes to `resources/views/vendor/livewire-upload-handler/`

### Themes

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire-upload-handler:themes
```

Publishes themes to `resources/vendor/livewire-upload-handler/themes/`

## Environment Variables

Add to `.env` for Glide configuration:

```env
GLIDE_IMAGE_DRIVER=gd  # or 'imagick'
GLIDE_SIGN_KEY=your-random-secret-key
```

Generate a sign key:

```bash
php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(32));"
```

## Git Configuration (Important)

When using Livewire uploads, two temporary file directories are automatically created:

1. **`storage/app/livewire-tmp/`** - Livewire temporary files (created by Livewire)
2. **`storage/app/.livewire-upload-handler-glide-cache/`** - Glide preview cache (created by this package)

**These directories should not be versioned in Git** as they contain automatically regenerated temporary files.

### Required Configuration

Add `livewire-tmp/` to your application's main `.gitignore`:

**`storage/app/.gitignore`**

```gitignore
*
!public/
!.gitignore
livewire-tmp/
```

Also create a dedicated `.gitignore` for the Glide cache:

**`storage/app/.livewire-upload-handler-glide-cache/.gitignore`**

```gitignore
*
!.gitignore
```

### Why?

**`livewire-tmp/`**: Temporarily stores uploaded files during processing. These files are automatically cleaned by Livewire.

**`.livewire-upload-handler-glide-cache/`**: Stores image previews generated by Glide during uploads. These files are:
- Temporary and regenerated on demand
- Environment-specific
- Unnecessary in the Git repository (increase repository size without reason)

### Automatic File Creation

You can create these configurations manually or use this command:

```bash
# Add livewire-tmp/ to main .gitignore
if ! grep -q "livewire-tmp/" storage/app/.gitignore 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "livewire-tmp/" >> storage/app/.gitignore
fi

# Create .gitignore for Glide cache
mkdir -p storage/app/.livewire-upload-handler-glide-cache && \
echo "*" > storage/app/.livewire-upload-handler-glide-cache/.gitignore && \
echo "!.gitignore" >> storage/app/.livewire-upload-handler-glide-cache/.gitignore
```
