# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a modern Laravel 12 package (requiring PHP 8.4+) that provides file upload handling using Livewire 3, with support for Spatie Media Library integration. The package handles chunked file uploads, image previews via Glide, file validation, and drag-and-drop functionality.

**Modern PHP Features:** The codebase utilizes PHP 8.4 features including asymmetric visibility, property hooks, typed exceptions, and enums for type safety.

## Development Commands

### Build Frontend Assets
```bash
npm run build
```
Compiles JavaScript and CSS using webpack. Creates both minified and non-minified JS builds, plus CSS bundle in `dist/` directory with a manifest.

### PHP Code Formatting
```bash
vendor/bin/pint
```
Formats PHP code according to Laravel Pint rules (configured in `pint.json`).

### Install Dependencies
```bash
composer install
npm install
```

## Architecture

### Core Component Hierarchy

The package uses a group/item architecture with two parallel hierarchies:

1. **Generic File Uploads**: `Group` (container) → `Item` (individual file)
2. **Media Library Integration**: `MediaGroup` (extends Group) → `MediaItem` (extends Item)

Both hierarchies follow the same pattern where:
- Group components manage multiple file items with optional sorting (Sortable.js)
- Item components handle individual file upload/download/deletion with chunked uploads

### Key Livewire Components

**Base Components** (src/Livewire/):
- `Group.php`: Base group component for managing multiple file uploads
- `Item.php`: Base item component for single file upload with chunking support
- `MediaGroup.php`: Extends Group to integrate with Spatie Media Library
- `MediaItem.php`: Extends Item to save files directly to Media Library

**Blade Component** (src/Components/):
- `Dropzone.php`: Simple Blade component wrapper for the dropzone view

### File Upload Flow

1. **Chunking**: Large files are split into chunks (configurable size from `upload_max_filesize`)
2. **Validation**: Files validated against MIME types and max size
3. **Storage**:
   - With `autoSave=true`: Files immediately saved to model/media library
   - With `autoSave=false`: Files kept as TemporaryUploadedFile until form submission
4. **Preview**: Image files generate thumbnails via Glide server

### Image Processing

The package integrates `axn/laravel-glide` for on-the-fly image manipulation:
- `GlideServerFactory.php`: Creates Glide servers per disk with signed URLs
- `GlideController.php`: Serves transformed images at `/livewire-upload-handler/glide/{disk}/{path}`
- Preview settings configurable per component or globally

### Theme System

The package uses a theme system (see `Livewire/Concerns/HasThemes.php`):
- CSS classes theme: Default is `bootstrap-5` (in `resources/themes/css-classes/`)
- Icons theme: Default is `fontawesome-7` (in `resources/themes/icons/`)
- Views can be published and customized per installation

### Routes

Registered in `routes/web.php`:
- `/livewire-upload-handler/assets/{fileName}`: Serves compiled JS/CSS from dist/
- `/livewire-upload-handler/glide/{disk}/{path}`: Image transformation endpoint

### Configuration

Main config in `config/livewire-upload-handler.php`:
- `chunk_size`: Based on PHP's `upload_max_filesize`
- `compressorjs_var`: Global JS variable for Compressor.js (optional)
- `sortablejs_var`: Global JS variable for Sortable.js (optional)
- `glide_*`: Glide server settings (driver, signing, preview dimensions)

### JavaScript Integration

The package requires two external libraries (not bundled):
- **Compressor.js**: Optional client-side image compression
- **Sortable.js**: Required if using sortable groups

Assets are loaded via Blade directives:
- `@livewireUploadHandlerScripts`: Injects config + compiled JS
- `@livewireUploadHandlerStyles`: Injects compiled CSS

### Component Properties

Key properties shared across Item/MediaItem:
- `autoSave`: If true, files saved immediately; if false, kept as temp files
- `onlyUpload`: If true, component shows only upload button (no file display)
- `previewImage`: Enable/disable image thumbnails
- `acceptsMimeTypes`: Array of allowed MIME types
- `maxFileSize`: Maximum file size in KB
- `compressorjsSettings`: Settings passed to Compressor.js
- `glidePreviewSettings`: Dimensions/fit settings for thumbnails

### Events Dispatched

- `livewire-upload-handler:uploaded`: When file upload completes (non-autoSave)
- `livewire-upload-handler:canceled`: When uploaded file is deleted
- `livewire-upload-handler:media-saved`: When file saved to Media Library
- `livewire-upload-handler:media-deleted`: When media file deleted

## Package Development Notes

### Extending Components

To create custom upload handlers:
1. Extend `Item` or `MediaItem`
2. Override methods like `saveUploadedFile()`, `savedFileId()`, `savedFileName()`, etc.
3. For groups, extend `Group` or `MediaGroup` and override `itemComponentClassName()`

### Testing Chunked Uploads

The chunked upload implementation follows the pattern from https://fly.io/laravel-bytes/chunked-file-upload-livewire/

Files are reassembled in `updatedChunkFile()` method by appending chunks to a temporary file until complete.

### Service Provider

`ServiceProvider.php` handles:
- Registering Livewire components with names like `upload-handler.group`
- Loading routes, views, translations
- Registering Blade directives for assets
- Publishing config, translations, views, and themes

### Webpack Build

The build system uses three separate webpack configs (in `webpack/` directory) that compile:
1. Non-minified JS (`scripts.js`)
2. Minified JS (`scripts.min.js`)
3. CSS bundle (`styles.css`)

After compilation, `build.js` merges partial manifests into final `dist/manifest.json`.

## Modern PHP 8.4 Features

### Enums

The package uses enums for type-safe constants:

- **`FileState`** (`src/Enums/FileState.php`): Represents file upload states (Uploading, Uploaded, Saved, Error, Deleted)
- **`MediaType`** (`src/Enums/MediaType.php`): Represents media types with MIME type detection (Image, Video, Audio, Document, Archive, Other)
- **`AssetType`** (`src/Enums/AssetType.php`): Represents asset types for the assets controller (JavaScript, CSS)

### Typed Exceptions

Custom exceptions for better error handling:

- **`UploadException`** (`src/Exceptions/UploadException.php`): For upload-related errors with factory methods like `chunkProcessingFailed()`, `validationFailed()`, `fileTooLarge()`
- **`FileNotHandledException`** (`src/Exceptions/FileNotHandledException.php`): For unimplemented methods in base classes, with clear error messages guiding users to either implement the method or use Media Library components

### Asymmetric Visibility (PHP 8.4)

Used in `Item.php` for properties that should be publicly readable but privately writable:
- `public private(set) ?int $uploadingFileSize`
- `public private(set) bool $hasErrorOnUpload`
- `public private(set) bool $hasFile`

This ensures encapsulation while maintaining Livewire's reactivity.

### Type Safety

All classes use:
- `declare(strict_types=1)` at the top
- Strict type hints for parameters and return types
- PHPDoc for array shapes (e.g., `@param array{id?: int|string|null, order?: int, deleted?: bool} $data`)
- `instanceof` checks instead of null comparisons for consistency
